# ImageToAscii
## Plan
A web server that will authenticate users using jwt, and then accept http requests containing images, covert those images to ASCII, and then send it back as text.

## Current Status
### 2/26/2021
A functional Express.js web server that will accept http form-requests containing an image, and return a json of the image in ascii format. Looking forward to learning how to deploy it to AWS.
