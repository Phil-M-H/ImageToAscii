A web server that will authenticate users using jwt, and then accept http requests containing images, covert those images to ASCII, and then send it back as text.

Deployed to AWS utilizing AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 

### 2/26/2021
A functional Express.js web server that will accept http form-requests containing an image, and return a json of the image in ascii format. Looking forward to learning how to deploy it to AWS.
